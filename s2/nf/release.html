<h1>Sweet Release (Day 4)</h1>

<h3><i>Lachlan Macleod, 2010</i></h3>

<p>
I thought it would be never ending<br>
But at last<br>
Sweet release<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
She came in<br>
While I was working<br>
Business Attire<br>
Wore it well...<br>
A coy smile<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
Not so cute as to<br>
Disarm<br>
Or to slap me across the face<br>
And make me<br>
Giddy<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
She was subtle<br>
The best kind of cute<br>
It may have taken a few seconds<br>
To even see it<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
Playful banter<br>
Tricky Machine<br>
Probably meant nothing<br>
I didn't get her number<br>
Or her name<br>
I may never see her again<br>
And it doesn't matter<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
She was a good distraction<br>
A reminder of the outside world<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
She didn't even look a little bit sassy<br>
And I doubt she enjoys jazz<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
But now I know<br>
You're far from the only fish in the sea<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
Still love you though ;)<br>
