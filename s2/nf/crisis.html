<h1>An Argument for Constant Crisis</h1>

<h3><i>Lachlan Macleod, 2008</i></h3>

<p>
My fellow students of the Arts<br>
I gathered you not just for food<br>
Or an excuse<br>
For drinking well-made wine<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
You’re here to witness my discovery:<br>
The essence of existence lies<br>
Here on my page<br>
The notes for this, my speech<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
And while my argument is sound<br>
I ask of you, please listen well<br>
To my full verbal exploration<br>
Of this new theorem<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
I read a quote from our man Chekhov<br>
“Any fool can best a crisis,<br>
Life is harder day to day”<br>
I paraphrase; the meaning stays the same<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
And what is it, my friends, that we<br>
Desire most from life? Who knows?<br>
We don’t know which is more important,<br>
Our finance and possessions, or our health<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
Confronted by this difficulty,<br>
Should we, in the interests of society,<br>
Make the answer clearer for our people<br>
By holding them in a constant state of crisis?<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
Is life not better in a crisis?<br>
Life gains meaning and significance<br>
Those who didn’t know their value before<br>
In crisis thrive<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
The layman rises in crisis<br>
From his day-job pushing papers,<br>
He emerges to commit heroic deeds<br>
And through crisis he will find self-value<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
Love erupts in crisis<br>
A husband and wife, previously locked in silent argument<br>
For fifteen years<br>
When facing death and destruction, they will speak again<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
So join me, brethren, on a destructive rampage<br>
For the good of all<br>
Come, we will destroy the city<br>
And in doing so give value to those prevailing lives<br>
</p>
