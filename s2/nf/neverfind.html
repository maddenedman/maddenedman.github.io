<h1>I Hope You Never Find This (Day 1)</h1>

<h3><i>Lachlan Macleod, 2010</i></h3>

<p>
I can't shout<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
Your communication<br>
Disarms my aggravation<br>
I want to be upset<br>
Angry<br>
But you speak<br>
It goes away<br>
As though I'm just glad we're still<br>
On speaking terms<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
I hate myself<br>
For being the weakness I saw in others<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
I hate being a slave<br>
To my own sentimentality<br>
The relief of my mood<br>
Has been entrusted to you<br>
Without my permission<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
I hate the thought<br>
That your words might mean<br>
Exactly what they say<br>
It's too easy an answer<br>
Simple to overcome<br>
If there is not more to the story<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
I wish you could tell me<br>
But I hate that I cannot ask<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
Despite your efforts to console<br>
With promises of loves better than you<br>
I can't choose my infatuations<br>
Nonetheless<br>
Neither can you<br>
It's decided<br>
Yours lies elsewhere<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
I know as well as you<br>
It doesn't go away<br>
When they say it should<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
The worst is,<br>
I can see myself<br>
Buried in the assurance<br>
That one day it might happen<br>
Despite the best intentions of my mind<br>
It is a naive hope-ridden deceiver<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
I can see<br>
The patterns I follow<br>
But I can't change them<br>
</p>
