<h1>Ethan Ramsey</h1>
<h2>Episode 04</h2>
<h3><i>Lachlan Macleod, 2007</i></h3>

<p>The curtains blew out of the window as Ethan Ramsey jumped through it. Behind him, an old man collapsed at a long table. The blood from his bullet wound dropped onto a pile of papers.

</p><p>Ethan dropped down to the ground, now on the outside of the building. He quickly scanned the area around him, and spotted the man he was after, Petron Yussen, the Disappearing Man. Petron ran around a corner, but was closely followed by Ethan. Ethan pulled out his pistol, and lifted it as he ran around the corner.

</p><p>Petron was standing directly in front of him. Ethan had not seen him there a moment before, but now the Disappearing Man was only inches away from Ethan's gun.

</p><p>Ethan felt a bead of sweat form on his forehead. Petron smiled.

</p><p>"Surprised?" Petron rubbed his face. "You got... so close to me, I figured... it's not going to be any different if I'm right in front of you. "

</p><p>Ethan scowled, and pulled the trigger. Petron was now standing beside Ethan. The Disappearing Man hit Ethan on the back of the head and ran.

</p><p>"What?" Ethan raised one hand to his head and looked up to see Petron stumbling down the pathway. "That's not your real reason. I think that you forgot that this alleyway is just a long straight road, and this time you have no time and no space to hide from me." He lifted his pistol again. "This time, you're stuck."

</p><p>Petron stopped running, and turned around. He looked at Ethan, with a worried look on his face. "Stuck?" He started walking towards Ethan. The man's knee-length coat began to ruffle, and then he broke into a stumbling run.

</p><p>Suddenly in a grave situation, Ethan panicked. His hands shook. What was the mysterious man planning? The pistol dropped from his hands, and he began to back away.

</p><p>Petron muttered something to himself, and then jumped at Ethan. Ethan ducked, but nothing happened. When he looked back, Petron had disappeared.

</p><p>"Not again," he muttered. Then he glimpsed the coat disappearing into a window a few levels from the ground. "Ha!" 

</p><p>There was a ladder leading up to the window, and when Ethan climbed through it he found himself in a dark office block. There were small office cubicles all through the building, but it was a large room. There was only one light on, but it flickered.

</p><p>Ethan heard a sound from the other end of the office. It sounded like Petron whispering. He listened more carefully.

</p><p>"Go, you damned animal!"

</p><p>There was a sound like a chain breaking, and a scuffling of claws. A large and rugged-looking grey wolf walked out of one of the office cubicles. It looked back into the cubicle, snarled, then turned towards Ethan.

</p><p>"A wolf? In an office?" Ethan stepped back towards the window as the wolf moved towards him. It snarled, and began to walk faster.

</p><p>Ethan took a step sideways, and entered an office cubicle. The walls did not reach the roof, so he stepped onto the desk and climbed over the wall, into the cubicle next to it. Looking back, he saw the wolf walking in, watching him climb the wall.

</p><p>The wolf jumped at him, causing him to jump down, and fall over. He stumbled out of the door, and back into a more open area. There was a shuffling from the cubicle that the wolf had come from earlier.

</p><p>"Damn, he's going."

</p><p>The wolf had jumped over him, and now stood very close. It opened its mouth and jumped at Ethan's throat, which he covered with his arm.

</p><p>The wolf bit down on his arm, and the weight of the snarling beast pushed him to the ground. Ethan tried to reach around with his free right arm to push the animal off him, but this caused the wolf to bite down harder on his left.

</p><p>The wolf stared into Ethan's eyes, and Ethan could feel his own blood drip onto his chest as the beast held his arm in its jaw.

</p><p>Suddenly, the wolf's eyes shot open, and it let go. It snarled at Ethan, then took a running jump out one of the windows.

</p><p>"What... was that?" Ethan let his injured arm fall to his side, and lay staring at the ceiling while he caught his breath. He stood up, and walked to the cubicle where Petron had sent the wolf from. There was no sign of the Disappearing Man. "He must have run away while I was distracted by the wolf."

</p><p>Ethan sighed, and walked to the door. His arm was still bleeding. It caused him no end of pain.

</p><p>"I will kill you, Petron." Ethan left the building.</p>
