<h1>Ethan Ramsey</h1>
<h2>Episode 06</h2>
<h3><i>Lachlan Macleod, 2007</i></h3>

<p>"Her name is... Amelia," said the tired-looking Langley, before slamming the door in Ethan's face.
</p><p>"Amelia..."</p>

<br>

</p><p>Ethan knocked on the door. There was silence for a few seconds before he knocked again. The rich king-pin had told him of Amelia. She had apparently been the latest fling of Petron's, only weeks before Ethan was assigned to him.

</p><p>"Try once more, Ethan," said the voice on the phone, "she could be the lead you require. She could lead you to Petron."

</p><p>"Fine."

</p><p>Ethan knocked again.

</p><p>Just as he was walking away, he heard a clutter coming from inside. A woman screamed.

</p><p>"There's something going on inside, Boss. I'll call you back."

</p><p>"What do you-"

</p><p>Ethan opened the unlocked door. Following the corridor around a bend, he saw a large dog standing over a young woman, who was crying, and had scratches on her face. Ethan jumped out from behind the cover of a wall, holding his pistol towards the creature, which turned to stare at him.

</p><p>It turned its entire body around and jumped at Ethan, who ducked. Suddenly, he was at the woman's side, and he turned to see  the dog take a last look at Ethan before scurrying out the door.

</p><p>"What was that thing?"

</p><p>The woman looked up at Ethan. "Nothing. It's a dog that hangs around here from time to time." She pushed him away. "Nothing at all for you to worry about."

</p><p>Ethan stood up and brushed the dust off his jacket. He breathed out.

</p><p>"I take it that you are Amelia?"

</p><p>Amelia stood up. "Yes. What is it to you?"

</p><p>"I'm... investigating someone who you have apparently been involved with."

</p><p>Amelia looked nervously at the door, then back at Ethan. "Who? I've been involved with a couple of people."

</p><p>"They call him 'The Disappearing Man.' I've been told his name is Petron."

</p><p>"Oh. Him." Amelia walked to the kitchen, where she turned on the tap and splashed water on her face to wash the blood off it. "Yes, I was with him for a time. I take it you've been assigned to kill him?"

</p><p>"I never said-"

</p><p>"Don't worry, I don't blame you." Amelia walked to the front door and closed it. "He wasn't particularly... consistent."

</p><p>"Do you have any idea where I could find him?"

</p><p>"As I said, he wasn't at all consistent." She turned to Ethan and pushed a strand of hair behind her ear. "There wasn't much pattern to him, so I have no idea where he is."

</p><p>There was a knock at the door. Amelia's eyes widened. "If I were you, I'd hide."

</p><p>"If it's the dog, I thought you said there was nothing to worry about."

</p><p>Amelia turned away from Ethan and opened the door.

</p><p>"What do you want?"

</p><p>A creaky sick voice came around the corridor and reached Ethan's ears. It sounded as though it belonged to someone who had a 
minimal life expectancy.

</p><p>"I have come for him."

</p><p>"Who?"

</p><p>"The one... named Ethan Ramsey." A figure stepped around into Ethan's sight. This was the first time Ethan had seen him in 
proper light. He was a tall man, though he had a stoop. He was unshaven, and looked like he fit in on the streets. His coat could have been made up of ten coats, or he could have been very well built.

</p><p>"Petron."

</p><p>Petron smiled with yellow uneven teeth. "Very... observant, Ethan."

</p><p>"What do you want with me?"

</p><p>"I'm afraid your snooping... has become a bit of a... nuisance to me."

</p><p>"So you'll just kill me here and now? In front of Amelia?" Ethan saw Amelia slowly making her way towards the door. She had fear in her eyes.

</p><p>"I've done it before. Amelia should know well enough."

</p><p>"I should let you know now, Petron..." Ethan pulled out a pistol. "I haven't been paid to investigate you. It's your death I have been sponsored for."

</p><p>Petron's smile faded, then a brick flew out of his jacket towards Ethan's head. Ethan blinked, and found himself standing behind the Disappearing Man, hand around his neck.

</p><p>"Smart move, Ethan... but you left your gun behind."

</p><p>There was a flash. Ethan fell to his knees, and only gained sight soon enough to see Petron's coat whip out the door. He looked up, and saw Amelia staring at him.

</p><p>"Are you going to follow him?" she said, "If you don't, he'll come back here anyway."

</p><p>Ethan stooped to pick up his pistol, and ran out the door, just in time to see Petron's coat pull onto a rooftop, at the top of a ladder.

</p><p>He tapped a button on his headset.

</p><p>"Boss. Good lead."</p>
