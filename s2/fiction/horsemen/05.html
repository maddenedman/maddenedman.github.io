<h1>Four Horsemen</h1>
<h2>Chapter 05</h2>
<h3><i>Lachlan Macleod, 2009</i></h3>

<p>Justin materialized under an old parking building in a familiar city. Birds’ wings flapped, wind hustled leaves around the pavement.
</p><p>A man in grey overalls finished painting over some graffiti.
</p><p>“Time’s passing,” thought Justin.
</p><p>He bolted through the city. He apologized for knocking over a young boy, and slipped on a stray newspaper. Recovery was instant.
</p><p>Justin began to think about Sarah as he ran. Her warm touch, her occasionally soothing voice. Her tendency to overlook his flaws. He smiled. It had definitely been worth all of the trouble, so that he could come back again.
</p><p>In the distance, Justin could see an ambulance, parked on the side of a busy road. Traffic was nudging past it on the busy street.
</p><p>This was the place.
</p><p>And there was Sarah, in a full embrace with a dashing young man in a paramedic’s uniform. Their lips were locked.
</p><p>Justin looked on in shock to see his old body still lying on the road. It had been cordoned off with traffic cones. There was a drying puddle of blood underneath it, which had made considerable headway down the gutter.
</p><p>Justin sighed. He should have known something like this would happen. The beeps of angry traffic filled the air. Two small children walked past, bickering and pushing each other.
</p><p>Justin suppressed the urge to let War’s sword appear. He couldn’t let this little thing bother him. After all, so far as Sarah could be concerned, Justin was dead.
</p><p>A thought grew in his mind. Why couldn’t he just make her pay for this? His dead body was still lying there on the road, and she was already on the rebound.
</p><p>Justin sighed, shook his head, and walked away. No action here could be for the best.
</p><br><p>***</p><br><p>
“Hugo.”
</p><p>“Justin? What happened to going back? What happened to Sarah?”
</p><p>“Didn’t work out. She’d… moved on.”
</p><p>“Bugger. Would you like us to deal you in on the next hand?”
</p><p>“Sure. Why not?”</p>
