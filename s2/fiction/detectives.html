<h1>The Night the Detectives Arrived</h1>
<h3><i>Lachlan Macleod, 2008</i></h3>

<p><i>We were asked in class to write a short story named "The Night the Detectives Arrived. After writing the first attempt, I was not satisfied, as I guessed it would be similar to everybody else's first thoughts on the title, so I wrote another.</p>

<p>Here they both are.</i></p>

<h2>(First Attempt)</h2>

<p>I turned the page, and leant back in my chair. There was a knock at the door. I nearly threw my book in shock. I swore, quietly but harshly. My wife would have cringed at the word.
</p><p>“Just a second,” I shouted, as I quickly shoved some things under the couch.
</p><p>I rubbed my eyes, so as to give them a tired look. Perhaps that would dismay them.
</p><p>As I opened the door, I saw two gentlemen, dressed like the Blues Brothers. I said nothing. After a moment’s silence, the one closest to me took off his sunglasses and spoke.
</p><p>“Do you mind if we come in?”
</p><p>“I’m quite tired, if you wouldn’t-“
</p><p>“It’s of… It’s… quite urgent.”
</p><p>“I’m afraid the house is messy.”
</p><p>“We… are not worried. Your wife has not been at work for two weeks. We would like to ask you some questions.”
</p><p>“Oh no, she’s here, she’s quite happy. I definitely didn’t kill her.”
</p><p>“Sir?”
</p><p>“Oh. Um. She’s just in her room. I’ll get her.
</p><p>As I looked back, an arm reached out from under the couch, and loudly pulled a standing light over. There was a groan.
</p><p>‘Oh shit’ I thought. ‘I didn’t kill her.’</p>

<h2>(Second Attempt)</h2>

<p>It was getting late, and the applicants were getting worse. There was no way that we would have a single good act for this year’s charity concert.
</p><p>The next act came in.
</p><p>I sighed. So did Geraldine. They were dressed like the Blues Brothers. And just to make it worse, there were three of them.
</p><p>“Well? Who are you?” I asked.
</p><p>“We…” started the front man, “are the Singing Detectives.”
</p><p>“Oh.” I would definitely need an entire bottle of bourbon tonight. This was going to be shit.
</p><p>Geraldine leant forward in her chair and started crying. I turned to the applicants and said, “I think that’s your sign to start.”
</p><p>The front man produced a guitar from behind him and, balancing it on his rotund stomach, began to play. I could tell from the get-go that his A-string was flat, and the G-string was sharp. This was going to break my mind.
</p><p>The terrible tunes that emerged from their mouths well and truly hurt my tender ears, and at many times during their song, Geraldine hit the table in pure frustration.
</p><p>I, too, put my head down on the table, and blocked my ears.
</p><p>A few seconds later, a gunshot rang out. I looked up in shock to see the guitar wielding man dead on the ground, a bullet hole punctuating his chubby face.
</p><p>I turned to Geraldine, gun in her hand. Tears were running down her face.
</p><p>“Well, gentlemen,” I said. “We’ll call you.”</p>
