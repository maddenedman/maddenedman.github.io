<h1>Tyranny</h1>

<h3><i>Lachlan Macleod, 2008</i></h3>

<p>Who would have thought that tyranny was so difficult? I had seen many previous leaders whimsically throw their citizens’ lives away, over as little as a stone stolen from the palace garden.
</p><p>After twenty-three years of hard work, I overthrew my governors, and took hold. Finally, I was in control. Yet somehow, I felt more in control before I was leader than now as the dictator.
</p><p>I slumped in the throne. The doors were thrown open. Two guards armed with pistols threw a scraggy looking man on his stomach in front of me. His hands were cuffed behind his back and he was having difficulty getting up.
</p><p>“Stand him up.” I ordered. The guards complied, and I saw the familiar face of a criminal. “What’s he here for this time?”
</p><p>One guard started talking, but was interrupted by the shouting ruffian.
</p><p>“I AM ACCUSED OF STANDING UP TO OUR OPPRESSORS!”
</p><p>“No need to shout, boy.” I readjusted myself in the seat, and looked into his eyes. “What did you do this time? Kill anyone?”
</p><p>The rough-haired man stared at my eyes in silence. A guard spoke for him.
</p><p>“He preached against you in public court, an offence punishable by death.”
</p><p>“Really? When did that law pass?”
</p><p>“It was the fourth of your new decrees when you became leader.”
</p><p>I nodded. The criminal continued to stare defiantly into my eyes. I caught a glimpse of his familiar face, but had to turn away.
</p><p>“Surely, there’s a way to bypass that law?”
</p><p>“If you allow it this time, you will only encourage further disobedience from your people.” The guard had a point. I cringed and rubbed my forehead.
</p><p>“Stand down, guards. Leave us alone for a minute. I’d like to speak to the man alone.” The guards looked in confusion at each other, and hesitantly left the room. I sighed, and stepped down towards the criminal.
</p><p>“You have no choice. You will have to kill me. If you don’t, the people will think you are softening up. And you will have a new uprising.”
</p><p>“I…” I hesitated. “I will help you escape. If you run away, then I can feign a search for you. I can organize transport to another country. You will be safe outside. I… I have no power in other countries.”
</p><p>The man was silent. He stared forwards defiantly. 
</p><p>“Are you offering me exile?”
</p><p>“No. I’m offering you freedom. Life.” I walked around and undid the man’s handcuffs. “There. Go. Run.”
</p><p>His hands remained behind his back, as I walked back to my throne.
</p><p>“I would recommend that you call your guards back in.” He said.
</p><p>“If I do that, then you won’t be able to leave!”
</p><p>“I don’t want to leave. I need to be here.”
</p><p>“But you’ll be killed!”
</p><p>“You passed the law. You enforce it.”
</p><p>I looked away. I couldn’t kill this man. It would cancel out everything I had done to get there.
</p><p>“Is that really what you want? Martyrdom?” My eyes were starting to water, so I hid them with my hand.
</p><p>There was a loud crash. I looked through teary eyes at the man, who had thrown a vase and its pedestal to the ground. He angrily ran towards another ornament, and kicked it over.
</p><p>The guards burst in with their guns at head height.
</p><p>“No!” I stood up and put my hand up powerlessly.
</p><p>The man stared furiously at one of the hesitating guards, and started advancing on him. The guard looked at me in confusion, and quickly fired a shot into the criminal’s shoulder. The man screamed but continued to walk forwards. He swung at the guard, crunching face with fist.
</p><p> The other guard took his baton and hit the criminal over the back of the head, instantly concussing him.</p>

<p>I took my chances to visit the man in his holding cell on death row two days later. Perhaps I could convince him now to leave.
</p><p>“There is transport waiting out the back. I have organized everything necessary for you to go. Please at least consider it. For my sake.”
</p><p>The man was quiet. He hadn’t eaten in a while, and his skin was pale. His hair and beard were scruffy, and he had scratches on his exposed skin.
</p><p>But his eyes remained calm.
</p><p>“I know what I need to do. I can’t leave now.”
</p><p>I sat down on the wooden cell bench next to him.
</p><p>“There is nothing that I can do to convince you then.”
</p><p>“No.”
</p><p>I breathed in, then out.
</p><p>“I guess… I see the error of my ways? Is that what you wanted? For me to admit that I’m doing bad?”
</p><p>“Yes.”
</p><p>“Well there’s not much I can do now, is there?” I rubbed my forehead. “If I make a sudden change in my ruling, I would make myself vulnerable. I would be overthrown in an instant. People would see that I have a weakness, and they would play on that to no end.”
</p><p>“They would.”
</p><p>“So can you see? Even if you die now, I can’t change my tyranny. What is the point of dying now, if you know it won’t change anything?”
</p><p>He was silent.
</p><p>“Why do you want to die, given a choice now?”
</p><p>“I simply have to. If I don’t die, if I run away, then I’ll have nothing left to live for.” He looked at me. “There’s nothing much else but this for me.”
</p><p>I nodded. There was nothing that I could say at all to sway him. I stood up. I walked to the door of the holding cell. “You’ve put me in a difficult place. I don’t know what I can do.”
</p><p>“There is only one thing you can do,” he said. “You’ll have to kill me, father.”</p>
